# Storage settings:
# There are currently two engines implemented: flatfile and MongoDB
# Flatfile simply stores it in an YAML file
# MongoDB stores it in...well...MongoDB
#
# MongoDB calls are performed async (using mongodb's new reactivestreams driver) to try to avoid any performance issues.
#
# Later down the line I will add support for SQL and other engines.
#
# OTP Settings:
# Issuer is your company/server name that will be used to identify the entry in the user's Authenticator app
# Digits lets you configure the length of the 2FA code generated by the app. By default it is 6, but can be set higher
# Current standard dictates it should fall in the range of six to nine.
#
#
# Message settings:
# If you run a network of servers and do not want players to re-authenticate everytime they switch servers, enable this.
# By default we will attempt to use plugin messaging and interact with the BungeeCord companion plugin.
# If you do not want to install a BungeeCord plugin we have a Redis PUBSUB implementation
# and will add a RabbitMQ plugin later down the line.
