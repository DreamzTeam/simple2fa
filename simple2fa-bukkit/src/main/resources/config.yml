# Storage settings:
# There are currently two engines implemented: flatfile and MongoDB
# Flatfile simply stores it in an YAML file
# MongoDB stores it in...well...MongoDB
#
# MongoDB calls are performed async (using mongodb's new reactivestreams driver) to try to avoid any performance issues.
#
# Later down the line I will add support for SQL and other engines.
#
# OTP Settings:
# Issuer is your company/server name that will be used to identify the entry in the user's Authenticator app
# Digits lets you configure the length of the 2FA code generated by the app. By default it is 6, but can be set higher
# Current standard dictates it should fall in the range of six to nine.
